                    <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>

                    <h2>Data Security</h2>
                    <p>
                        We implement security measures designed to protect your
                        personal information from unauthorized access,

                        electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while we
                        strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect
                        your personal information, we cannot guarantee its

                        processed in countries other than the country in which
                        you are resident. These countries may have data
                        protection laws that are different from the laws of your
                        country.

                        have collected personal information from a child under
                        18, we will take steps to delete the information as soon
                        as possible.
